# When to use algorithms

+ **Use Topological Sort** when dealing with **DAGs** to find the shortest path efficiently.

+ **Use BFS** for finding the shortest path in terms of the number of edges in **unweighted graphs**.

+ **Use Dijkstra's Algorithm** for finding the shortest path in **weighted graphs without negative weights**.

+ **Use Bellman-Ford** when dealing with **weighted graphs that may contain negative weights** but no negative cycles.
